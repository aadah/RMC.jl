\begin{abstract}
We introduce a novel dual-purpose algorithm for MCMC sampling and constrained
nonlinear optimization. The method simulates a particle bouncing across a
surface whose shape is determined by the target distribution or objective
function, using a notion of entropic dissipation that resembles simulated
annealing without any acceptance step. Similarly, the simple closed-form
parabolic trajectories means avoiding costly and potentially unstable numerical
integrations to compute trajectories. This enables a more efficient simulation,
reducing total evaluations of the target. Our method easily extends to handle
nonlinear constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several
distributions and nonlinear test functions.

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by
% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was created
% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019 and 2021 and by Csaba Szepesvari, Gang Niu and Sivan Sabato in 2022.
% Modified again in 2023 by Sivan Sabato and Jonathan Scarlett.
% Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
