\section{Ricochet Monte Carlo} \label{s:rmc}

The intuition behind Ricochet Monte Carlo (RMC) is to treat our target
distribution or objective as a sort of hilly terrain across which a point
particle freely bounces along. The points where the particle collides with this
surface are candidate samples to either be accepted and rejected. The particle
will continue to bounce, until it settles in some "valley", at which time it is
picked up and tossed in a random direction to repeat the process.

Let \target{} be some probability distribution to sample from, defined as
\begin{equation*}
    \target{} \coloneqq \frac{\energy{}}{Z}
\end{equation*}
where $Z$ is some intractable normalizing constant and \energy{} is the
associated joint distribution, which is assumed tractable and known. We are
interested in generating samples $\thetai{} \sim \F$ that live in a continuous
$d$-dimensional vector space, where $i$ means the $i$th sample. We perform the
standard transformation as done in HMC and define our \emph{surface} as
\begin{equation*}
    \label{eq:surface}
    \surface{} \coloneqq - \log \energy{}.
\end{equation*}
If instead \target{} is a nonlinear objective function to minimize, then we
simply set $\surface{} \coloneqq \target{}$.

\subsection{Auxillary variables} \label{ss:auxillary}

For each value of \thetab{}, we associate an auxillary \emph{height} scalar
\h{}. We define a $(d+1)$-length \emph{position} vector $\q{} \coloneqq
[\thetab{}; \h{}]$. We also create an auxillary $(d+1)$-length \emph{position}
vector \p{}. We define
\begin{align*}
    \thetaof{\qi{}} &\coloneqq  \thetai{} \\
    \hof{\qi{}}     &\coloneqq  \hi{}
\end{align*}
to respectively refer to the specific sample and height components of any
particular \qi{}. Similarly, we overload \thetaof{\pi{}} to be the vector of
the first $d$ entries of \pi{}.

We maintain an invariant where the particle is always "above" the surface \S,
i.e.
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:collision}
    \CSof{\q{}} \coloneqq \hof{\q{}} - \Sof{\thetaof{\q{}}} > 0.
\end{equation}
\cref{eq:collision} defines the \emph{surface collision} constraint \CS{}. This
terminology will be used to distinguish it from any later nonlinear constraints
that will be handled in the optimization formulation. All together, \q{}, \p{},
and \S{} fully describe the state of our system.

\subsection{Simulation with Hamiltonian dynamics} \label{ss:hamiltonian}

To simulate the particle's trajectory across the surface, we start with its
associated Hamiltonian equations. Given scalars $m > 0$ and $g > 0$, we define
\begin{align*}
    H(\q{}, \p{}) &\coloneqq U(\q{}) + K(\p{}) \\
    U(\q{}) &\coloneqq m \cdot g \cdot \hof{\q{}} \\
    K(\p{}) &\coloneqq \frac{\lVert \p{} \rVert^2}{2m}.
\end{align*}
We respectively call $m$ and $g$ the \emph{mass} and \emph{gravity}, and both
are hyperparameters of RMC. For convenience of notation, let $\g{} \coloneqq
[\mathbf{0}_d; g]$ where $\mathbf{0}_d$ is a $d$-length zero vector. The
dynamics of the particle are governed by the following system of differential
equations:
\begin{alignat}{4}
    &\frac{d\q{}}{dt} = &&\frac{\partial H}{\partial \p{}} = &&\frac{dK}{d\p{}} = &&\frac{\p{}}{m} \label{eq:dqdt} \\
    &\frac{d\p{}}{dt} = -&&\frac{\partial H}{\partial \q{}} = -&&\frac{dU}{d\q{}} = -&&m\g{}. \label{eq:dpdt}
\end{alignat}
In order to simulate the particle trajectory, HMC employs Euler's "leapfrog"
integration, which requires an acceptance step to account for the case when the
Hamiltonian $H$ isn't conserved. In RMC's case, because \cref{eq:dqdt,eq:dpdt}
don't involve what could be an arbitrarily complex \surface{}, we can easily
solve for the time-parametrized closed forms:
\begin{align}
    \qt{} &= \qz{} + \frac{\pz{}}{m}t - \frac{\g{}}{2}t^2 \label{eq:qt} \\
    \pt{} &= \pz{} - m\g{}t. \label{eq:pt}
\end{align}
We use \cref{eq:qt,eq:pt} to find the next candidate sample \thetai{} by
computing the earliest $t'$ for which $\CSof{\qof{t'}} = 0$. This search is done
using a two-step process that increases $t'$ in doubling increments until a
collision, and then does a binary search within a time-bounded window to find
the near-exact $t'$ representing the point of collision while still satisfying
$\CSof{\qof{t'}} > 0$. [ALGORITHM TODO] outlines this in fuller detail.

\subsection{Sampling at collisions} \label{ss:sampling}

Once $t'$ is had, we compute the position $\qu{t'} \coloneqq \qof{t'}$ and
momentum $\pu{t'} \coloneqq \pof{t'}$. The acceptance probability of the
candidate sample $\thetaof{\qu{t'}}$ is defined in terms of \emph{lateral
momentum}: ignoring the height component, if the angle of the reflection is
particularly sharp, we are more likely to reject it. The reasoning is that these
"hard" bounces represent regions of low probability in \target{}. If we let
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbf{n} \coloneqq \frac{\nabla \CSof{\qu{t'}}}{\lVert \nabla \CSof{\qu{t'}} \rVert}
\end{equation*}
be the unit normal at \qu{t'}, we can define the momentum after reflecting off
the surface as
\begin{equation}
    \overleftarrow{\pu{t'}} \coloneqq \pu{t'} - 2 \cdot \left<\pu{t'}, \mathbf{n}\right> \cdot \mathbf{n}. \label{eq:p_after_simple}
\end{equation}
Our acceptance probability is thus
\begin{equation}
    \Pr\left(\textsc{accept} \mid \pu{t'}, \overleftarrow{\pu{t'}} \right) 
    \coloneqq \frac{1}{2}
    \left(1 + \frac{
        \left<\thetaof{\pu{t'}},\thetaof{\overleftarrow{\pu{t'}}}\right>
    }{
        \lVert \thetaof{\pu{t'}} \rVert \lVert \thetaof{\overleftarrow{\pu{t'}}} \rVert
    }\right).
\end{equation}
If accepted, then we set $\thetai \leftarrow \thetaof{\qu{t'}}$. Whether the
sample is accepted or rejected, we still continue on with the simulation
by setting $(\qz{}, \pz{}) \leftarrow (\qu{t'}, \pu{t'})$ in \cref{eq:qt,eq:pt}.

\subsection{Entropic dissipation} \label{ss:entropy}

Given a scalar $\epsilon \in (0,1]$, we modify \cref{eq:p_after_simple} slightly:
\begin{equation}
    \overleftarrow{\pu{t'}} \coloneqq \epsilon \cdot \left(\pu{t'} - 2 \cdot \left<\pu{t'}, \mathbf{n}\right> \cdot \mathbf{n}\right). \label{eq:p_after}
\end{equation}
The value $\epsilon$ is known in the physics literature as the \emph{coefficient
of restitution}, a ratio of the velocities before and after an inelastic
collision. If $\epsilon = 1$, that is an elastic collision and we have
\cref{eq:p_after_simple} again.

After enough collisions, all the energy of the Hamiltonian will be concentrated
in $U$ as the particle settles into a stable equilibrium of \surface{}. This
means the particle has found at least a local minimum. In the nonlinear
optimization view, the value \thetab{} at these moments are solutions 

% : With \epsilon = 1, eventually all the "energy" of H will be in U. S is
% finitely deep, and gravity is pulling the particle down. Collisions take away
% from K only, total H goes down. This means as t->inf, p0 in eqs 4/5 -> 0.

\subsubsection{Refreshing momentum} \label{ss:momentum}
% - when the kinetic energy K has "puttered out" / "lost steam"

Between refreshes, we yield some undefined number of samples, different each
time and hard to predict.

\subsection{Handling boundary constraints} \label{ss:constraints}
% - motivation: some \theta_j could be a non-negative parameter in a graphical model, e.g. Beta
% - we could take the log of them, or treat them as an infinitely tall wall
% - constraint as 3-tuple (j, a, b) where a < b and j \in {1,...,d}
% - normal simply zero vector with 1 at location j
% - reflection is just multiple p_j by -1
% - we *don't* sample if collision is on boundary wall, and not S

\subsection{Initialization} \label{ss:initialization}

\subsection{Full algorithm} \label{ss:algo}
% - what are the hyperparameters
% - initialization
% - starting height?
% - clamp q to any boundary constraints
% - actual pseudocode
