\section{Theoretical analysis \& discussion}
% - runtime and space
% - ergodicity / time-reversibility / detailed balance
% - relation between hyperparameters and convergence guarantees
% - hyperparameter tuning

\subsection{Potential extensions}
% - stochastic gradient, i.e. S changes with each batch X, faster compute of S
% - step-wise distributions where walls are finitely tall
% - n-nary boundary constraints (e.g. uniform dist a<b) and how to reflect/resolve
% - more efficient collision checking (very expensive if S(\theta) is non-trivial)
