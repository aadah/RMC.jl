% - HMC
% - BPS
% - differences between both, such as
% with HMC:
% - HMC as an acceptance propability proportional to how well H was preserved, whereas RMC allows for annealing
%   - question: does annealing help with integration?
% - HMC treats distribution modes as separate gravitational well. RMC has one "planet"
% - HMC particle is frictionless puck on S, RMC particle bounces around S
% - no trajectory length L in RMC, in fact # of leapfrogs steps is hard to predict
% - between momentum refreshes, HMC gets at most 1 sample. RMC gets several
% with BPS:
