\section{Experiments}
\subsection{Distribution sampling}
\subsubsection{Single gaussian}
% - 1D, 2D, and 1000D cases
% - visualize estimated samples and trajectories

\subsubsection{Mixture of varied gaussians}
\subsubsection{Lopsided distributions}
\subsubsection{Graphical model with boundary constraints}
% - use coin flip model with Beta prior on flip prob \phi. \theta = [a, b, \theta]
% - sub-exp 1: a, b fully continuous and we use exp(-a) and exp(-b) as Beta params
% - sub-exp 2: a, b be as in Beta prior but constrained, need to do ricocheting

\subsection{Nonlinear programming}
