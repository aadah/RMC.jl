1. It generally pays off to have a sensible story line. Like: don't just say, "we did stuff X and it works well and here is why", but have a compelling argument for why your stuff is awesome. Sell your idea, don't just present it. This is NIPS we're talking about, not a boring science conference.
1. It always helps to have a theorem or two in there. It doesn't even have to be a good/fundamental one. Some reviewers just really like it when you have theorems.
1. Math is good. You have to strike a balance between having too much math ("you should submit this to COLT instead") and not having enough. If all else fails, write down the definition of a logistic sigmoid or a softmax. Ideally in an align-block.
1. Make sure you actually hit the paper limit. ICML accepts 8 pages + 1 of references. If your idea fits on 7.5 pages, it clearly isn't fleshed out enough yet.
1. Make sure you cite everyone who could be a potential reviewer, no matter how relevant their contributions.
1. It helps to make your paper look like it comes from some bigshot labs. There are certain papers that some labs always cite / arguments they often bring / words they prefer. It's much harder to shut down a presumably bigshot professor than a nobody.
1. If you want to write an application paper, make sure it's about audio, images or video. No-one really cares about other application areas, unless your plan was to submit to workshops in the first place.
1. Do repeat experiments and have confidence values on your results. For a field that does a lot of Bayesian stuff, ML reviewers are very fond of those. If you can't do repeats, just be creative with how you define confidence.
1. Make sure your work is novel. Meaning, work the word "novel" into the abstract and conclusion. Use the introduction to actually explain why your work is novel (spoiler alert: the papers who actually did the same thing you did have probably done so only as a side-note. Make sure you point out that their paper was about something else entirely).
